<b>MEAN ERROR OF PROBABILITY DIAGRAM</b>

<p>The mean error of probability diagram (MEPD) measures the reliability of an ensemble forecasting
system in an unconditional sense.  Let z<sub>ij</sub> denote the jth of m ensemble members from the ith of 
n ensemble forecasts and let x<sup>o</sup><sub>i</sub> denote the observed outcome associated 
with the ith ensemble forecast.  The forecast climatology has an empirical distribution function, <img src="images/MEP_1.gif" align=middle>, 
which is computed from the n ensemble forecasts as</p>

<p><img src="images/MEP_2.gif"></p> 

<p>and <img src="images/MEP_3.gif" align=middle> is a step function that assumes value 1 if the condition is met and 0 otherwise.  
Let <img src="images/MEP_4.gif" align=middle> denote an interval of fixed width on the support of <img src="images/MEP_1.gif" align=middle>.  
The MEPD counts the fraction of observations that fall within the interval, H, namely</p>
<p><img src="images/MEP_5.gif" align=middle></p> 
<p>An ensemble forecasting system is unconditionally reliable or marginally calibrated over the interval, H, if it captures 
observations in proportion to the width of that interval</p>

<p>The MEPD shows <img src="images/MEP_7.gif" align=middle> against the width of H for each of k windows that span the unit interval.  In practice, 
the k windows may cover any subintervals of the unit interval.  The MEPD is similar to the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot (Wilks, 2006) and the 
probability-probability (P-P) plot (Shorack and Wellner, 1986; Gneiting et al., 2007).  The Q-Q plot compares the order statistics of 
two samples, or the order statistics of one sample against the values of a theoretical distribution at corresponding quantiles (Wilks, 2006).  
The P-P plot compares the quantiles corresponding to these order statistics.  Indeed, the MEPD is equivalent to a P-P plot of the 
climatological distributions of the ensemble forecasts and observations when evaluated for the n intervals,  <img src="images/MEP_8.gif" align=middle>. 
As indicated above, the MEPD assumes asymptotic convergence of <img src="images/MEP_7.gif" align=middle> as <img src="images/MEP_9.gif" align=middle>.  In practice, 
this may be evaluated by comparing the <img src="images/MEP_7.gif" align=middle> for g subsamples of the n available data.</p>
