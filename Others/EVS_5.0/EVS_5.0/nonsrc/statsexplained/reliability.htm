<b>RELIABILITY DIAGRAM</b>

<p>The reliability diagram measures the accuracy with which a discrete event is forecast by an ensemble 
or probabilistic forecasting system.  The discrete event may be defined in several ways.  For example, 
flooding is a discrete event that involves the exceedence of a flow threshold.  According to the reliability 
diagram, an event should be observed to occur with the same relative frequency as its forecast probability
of occurrence over a large number of such forecast-observation pairs.  For example, over a large number of cases
where flooding is forecast to occur with a probability of 0.95, it should be observed to occur roughly 95% of 
the time.  However, the calculation of the observed relative frequency is subject to sampling uncertainty.  
For example, there may be few cases in the historic record where flooding is forecast to occur with probability 
0.95.  In practice, the forecasts are binned into discrete probability intervals and the observed relative 
frequencies are plotted against the average forecast probability within each bin.  The sampling uncertainty 
will decline as the width of the bin increases, but the precision of the diagram will also decline.</p>

<p>The Reliability diagram plots the average forecast probability within each bin on the x-axis.  
For a forecast event defined by the non-exceedence of some threshold, t, the average
probability of the forecasts that fall in the <i>k</i>th forecast bin, B<sub>k</sub> is given by:</p>

<p>where I<sub>k</sub> denotes the set of all indices, <img src="images/REL_2.gif" align=middle>, whose forecasts (and associated paired observations)
fall in the <i>k</i>th bin and #I<sub>k</sub> denotes the number of elements in that set.  The y-axis shows the corresponding fraction of observations 
that fall in the <i>k</i>th bin:</p>

<p><img src="images/REL_3.gif"></p>

<p>where <img src="images/REL_4.gif" align=middle> is a step function that has value 1 if 
the observation exceeds the threshold, t, and 0 otherwise.  If the forecast is perfectly reliable, the observed 
fraction within each bin will equal the average of the associated forecast probabilities, forming a diagonal line 
on the reliability diagram.  Deviation from the diagonal line represents bias in the forecast 
probabilities, notwithstanding sampling uncertainty.  The reliability diagram may be computed for several discrete
events.  Each event is represented by a separate reliability curve.</p>

<p>Collectively, the number of forecasts that fall within each of the <i>k</i> bins, #I<sub>k</sub>, is referred to 
as the 'sharpness' of the forecasts and is displayed as a histogram for each of the forecast bins.  Ideally, 
the forecast probabilities will be sharp, i.e. issued with little uncertainty, but also reliable.</p>
