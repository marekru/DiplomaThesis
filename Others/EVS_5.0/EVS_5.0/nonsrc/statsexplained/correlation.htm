<b>CORRELATION COEFFICIENT</b>

<p>The correlation coefficient measures the strength of linear association between two variables.  Here, 
it measures the linear relationship between n pairs of forecasts and corresponding observations, where the 
forecasts are given by a measure of central tendency of the ensemble members (the mean average value, by default).  
A correlation coefficient of -1.0 denotes a perfect inverse linear relationship (i.e. the observed values increase when the forecasts values decline and 
vice versa).  The ensemble forecast average may be perfectly correlated with the observations and 
still contain biases, because the correlation coefficient is normalized by the overall
mean of each variable.  A correlation coefficient of 0.0 denotes the absence of any 
linear association between the forecasts and observations.  However, a low 
correlation coefficient may occur in the presence of a strong non-linear relationship, because 
the correlation coefficient measures linear association only.</p>

<p>EVS computes the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, r, which is given by</p>
