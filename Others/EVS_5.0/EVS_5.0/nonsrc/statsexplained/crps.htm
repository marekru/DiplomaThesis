<b>MEAN CONTINUOUS RANKED PROBABILITY SCORE</b>

<p>The Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) summarizes the quality of a continuous probability 
forecast with a single number (a score).  It measures the integrated square difference between 
the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the forecast variable, F<sub>Y</sub>(y), and the 
corresponding cdf of the observed variable, <img src="images/CRPS_1.gif" align=middle></p>

<p><img src="images/CRPS_2.gif"></p>

<p>where <img src="images/CRPS_1.gif" align=middle> is a step function that assumes probability 1.0 for 
values greater than or equal to the observation, and 0.0 otherwise.  
In practice, the CRPS is averaged across n pairs of forecasts and observations, 
which leads to the mean CRPS</p>

<p>The numeric value of the mean CRPS will vary with application and is difficult
to interpret in absolute terms (e.g. in terms of specific forecast errors).  However, 
the CRPS has some desirable mathematical properties, including its insensitivity to 
hedging (i.e. the expected value of the score cannot be improved, <i>a priori</i>, by 
adopting a particular forecasting strategy).  Other scores, such as the Probability Score 
of Wilson <i>et al.</i> (1999), may be hedged (in this case by issuing sharper forecasts).</p>

<p>Optionally, the mean CRPS may be decomposed into contributions due to (lack of)
reliability, resolution and uncertainty (Hersbach, 2000), where </p>
