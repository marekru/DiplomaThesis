<b>RELATIVE OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC)</b>

<p> The Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC; also known as the Receiver Operating Characteristic) measures 
the quality of a forecast for the occurrence of a discrete event, such as rainfall or flooding. For a probability forecast, 
the ROC curve measures the quality of a binary prediction or "decision" based on the forecast probability. A binary prediction 
is generated from the forecast by defining a probability threshold above which the discrete event is considered to occur. 
For example, a decision maker might issue a flood warning when the forecast probability of a flood exceeds 0.9.  
The ROC curve plots the forecast quality for several probability thresholds. Each threshold corresponds to a different 
level of risk aversion. For example, given a decision on whether to issue a flood warning, a probability threshold of 0.7 
corresponds to a higher level of risk aversion (i.e. a lower threshold for warning) than a probability of 0.9.  
As the threshold declines, the probability of correctly detecting an event (the Probability of Detection or POD) will 
increase, but the probably of "crying wolf" (the probability of False Detection or POFD) will also increase.  
The ROC curve plots the trade off between POD and POFD on two axes:</p>

<p>
The POD or probability with which an event is correctly forecast to occur. The POD is estimated from n sample data as 
the total number of correct forecasts divided by the total number of occurrences. For an event defined by the exceedance 
of a real-valued threshold, t, which is forecast to occur when the forecast probability exceeds a probability threshold, p<sub>t</sub>, 
the POD is given by

The POFD or probability with which an event is incorrectly forecast to not occur (i.e. the event occurs, but the forecast was 
for non-occurrence). The POFD is estimated from n sample data as the total number of incorrect forecasts divided by the total 
number of non-occurrences

<p>These values are computed for probability thresholds that exhaust the unit interval, which is normally 
defined by a number of plotting points, q, that separate the unit interval, [0,1], into q thresholds at equal
intervals

<p>Additionally, the curve is forced to intersect (0,0), and (1,1). </p>

<p>For an ensemble forecasting system to perform well in terms of ROC, the POD must be high relative to the 
POFD. An ensemble forecasting system that produces forecasts in line with climatological expectation will have 
as many "successful" predictions as the climatological probability of the event implies. A skillful 
forecasting system will always produce a ROC curve that lies above the diagonal line.</p> 

<p>Practical applications of the ROC in the medical, atmospheric, and other sciences frequently fit a smooth
curve to the empirical POD and POFD data.  A common approach is to fit a binormal model, which assumes that the 
POD and POFD are normally distributed, each with given mean and variance (standard deviation).  Experience has 
shown that the binormal model typically provides a good fit to the empirical POD and POFD, even when they are 
"significantly" non-normal (i.e. the binormal approximation is robust).  The binormal model is given by</p>

<p><img src="images/ROC_5.gif"></p> 

<p>Here, <img src="images/ROC_6.gif" align=middle> is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, 
<img src="images/ROC_7.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/ROC_8.gif" align=middle> are, respectively, the means of the POD
and POFD, and <img src="images/ROC_9.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/ROC_10.gif" align=middle> are their corresponding standard
deviations.</p>

<p>There are several approaches to estimating the parameters of the binormal model, a and b (or the means and 
standard deviations from which they are derived; for example, see Cai and Moskowitz, 2004). The simplest and 
most direct approach stems from the observation that</p>

<p><img src="images/ROC_11.gif"></p> 

<p>Hence, the parameters, a and b, are the intercept and slope, respectively, of a linear (regression) relationship 
between the POD and POFD <i>following</i> their transformation to the probit scale.  The EVS estimates these parameters through 
ordinary least squares regression.  While the resulting model fit is mathematically correct, the standard errors of 
the model (or confidence intervals for the associated <a href="rocscore.htm">ROC Score</a>) cannot be computed in 
this way, and are not reported by the EVS.  Since the parameters of the binormal model are estimated from the empirical 
POD and POFD, the model fit will depend on the number of probability thresholds used to compute the ROC curve.  The 
number of thresholds cannot (usefully) exceed the number of ensemble members, m, (or m+1 thresholds) from which the POD and 
POFD are derived, as the ensemble forecast only contains information at these thresholds (members).  However, the 
binormal curve is plotted for a large number of points in between these thresholds, in order to convey the smoothness 
of the fitted model.</p>

<p>The <a href="rocscore.htm">ROC Score</a> is derived from the Area Under the Curve (AUC). For the binormal model,
the AUC is an analytical function of the binormal model parameters</p>

<p><img src="images/ROC_12.gif"></p> 

<p>Upon request, the binormal approximation to the <a href="rocscore.htm">ROC Score</a> is provided by the 
EVS. Since the model fit depends on the number of thresholds used to compute the ROC curve, the number of 
thresholds must be defined when computing the binormal approximation to the <a href="rocscore.htm">ROC Score</a>. 
For an exact comparison between the binormal ROC curve and the binormal <a href="rocscore.htm">ROC Score</a> 
(or AUC), the same number of thresholds, q, must be used for each metric.</p>
