<b>MODIFIED BOX PLOT OF FORECAST ERRORS POOLED BY FORECAST LEAD TIME</b>

<p>Constructs a modified box plot where the errors are plotted for one or
more forecast lead times.  For each lead time, the errors from multiple 
forecast times are pooled.</p> 

<p>Conventional box plots (or box-and-whisker diagrams) provide a discrete representation 
of a continuous empirical probability distribution (Tukey, 1977).</p>  

<p>Building on this idea, an empirical pdf may be 
summarized with an arbitrary set of percentile bins of which an arbitrary 
proportion may be shaded (e.g. the middle 60%), to convey the outer 
and inner probability densities, respectively.  The percentile bins are 
specified as probabilities in the probability threshold parameter box 
(e.g. 0.1 represents a percentile bin of 0-10%).  An example is given below.</p>  

<p>Modified box plots were derived from 6-hourly forecasts of temperature 
and precipitation at Huntingdon, PA, USA.  The temperature forecasts were evaluated
at lead day 1 for the period 12/1993-12/1998.  The precipitation forecasts were
evaluated at lead day 1 for the period 08/2002-09/2005.  The plots were generated 
for deciles of the empirical pdfs, of which the middle 60 percent were shaded.  <i>Figure
1</i> shows the temperature errors against forecast date, F<sub>E</sub>(e)
or F<sub>E|T</sub>(e|t), while <i>figure 2 </i>shows the temperature errors 
against forecast value, F<sub>E|Y</sub>(e|y), ordered by increasing y and 
binned such that each box contains 0.05% of the forecasts.  <i>Figure 3</i> shows
precipitation errors against observed values, ordered by increasing magnitude 
of precipitation and for positive observed precipitation only, F<sub>E|X</sub>(e|x)
where x &gt; 0.  The boxes were averaged for duplicate values of x.  These plots 
reveal a range of conditional biases in the temperature and precipitation 
forecasts.  For example, the latter consistently underpredict large observed events (<i>figure 3</i>).
This is consistent with the calibration of meteorological models for 'average conditions'.  Similarly, 
the temperature forecasts display clear periodic biases in the ensemble mean, 
both with time (<i>figure 1</i>) and forecast value (<i>figure 2</i>).
