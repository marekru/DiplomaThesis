<b>RELATIVE MEAN ERROR</b>

<p>The relative mean error (RME), or relative bias, measures the mean difference between a set of
forecasts and corresponding observations, divided by the mean of the observations.  Here, it measures 
the relative mean difference between the center of the ensemble forecast (the mean average value, 
by default) and the observations.</p>

<p>Given n pairs of forecasts and observations, the RME of the center of the ensemble forecast,

<p><img src="images/RME_2.gif">.</p>

<p>The RME provides a measure of relative, first-order, bias in the forecasts, and may be positive, 
zero, or negative.  A positive RME denotes overforecasting and a negative RME
denotes underforecasting (assuming that the chosen measure of central tendency should match the
observed value, on average).  A RME of zero denotes the absence of relative bias in the center of 
the ensemble forecast.
