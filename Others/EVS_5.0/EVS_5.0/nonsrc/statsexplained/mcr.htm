<b>THE MEAN CAPTURE RATE</b>

<p>A key aspect of forecast quality is the probability of making a given error in real terms.  
The Probability Score (PS) of Wilson <i>et al.</i> (1999) is useful here because it identifies the 
probability with which a given, real-valued, error is exceeded.  The PS is defined for a 
symmetric window, w, around the observation, x</p>

<p>It conveys the extent to which an observation is captured by the forecast, where a high probability
implies greater forecast performance.  The disadvantages of the PS include its subjectivity 
and sensitivity to hedging, whereby the expected value of the PS is maximized for sharp forecasts.  
By averaging the PS over a set of n ensemble forecasts and repeating for all possible windows, w, 
the probability of exceeding a given acceptable error can be determined, and is referred to as 
the Mean Capture Rate (MCR)</p>

<p>It should be noted that sensitivity to hedging does not apply to the MCR, as it is not a score.</p>
