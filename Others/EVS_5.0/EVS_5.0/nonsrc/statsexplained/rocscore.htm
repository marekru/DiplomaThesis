<b>RELATIVE OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) SCORE</b>

<p>The <a href="roc.htm">Relative Operating Characteristic</a> (also known as the Receiver Operating Characteristic) measures 
the quality of a forecast for the occurrence of a discrete event, such as rainfall or flooding.
It does not consider the quality of forecasts that predict no occurrence of the event defined (e.g. no rainfall 
or no flooding).</p>
 
<p>The ROC Score is based on the area underneath the ROC curve or AUC, which is normalized
by the AUC of a reference forecast, <a><img src="images/ROCS_1.gif"></a> (Mason and Graham, 2002). The 
AUC of the climatological probability forecast is 0.5, which corresponds to the diagonal line in 
the ROC plot.  Thus, the ROC Score for the climatological probability forecast is</p>

<p>As discussed under the <a href="roc.htm">Relative Operating Characteristic</a>, practical applications of 
ROC analysis in the medical, atmospheric, and other sciences frequently fit a smooth curve to the paired values
of the Probability of Detection (POD) and Probability of False Detection (POFD) derived from the sample data.  
A common approach is to fit a binormal model, which assumes that the POD and POFD are normally distributed, each 
with given mean and variance (standard deviation).  Experience has shown that the binormal model typically 
provides a good fit to the empirical POD and POFD, even when the sample data are "significantly" non-normal 
(i.e. the binormal approximation is robust).  The binormal approximation to the AUC (and hence the ROC Score) 
is given by</p>

<p><a><img src="images/ROCS_3.gif"></a></p>

<p>Here, a and b are the parameters of the binormal model, and <img src="images/ROCS_4.gif"> is the cumulative 
distribution function of the standard normal distribution.  The parameters a and b are, respectively, the 
intercept and slope of the (assumed) linear relationship between the POD and POFD <i>following</i> their
transformation to the probit scale (see the discussion under the <a href="roc.htm">Relative Operating 
Characteristic</a>).  Unlike the empirical AUC (Mason and Graham, 2002), which bypasses the calculation of
the ROC curve, the binormal approximation to the AUC (and ROC Score) is based on the q pairs of (POD, POFD) 
data from which the empirical ROC curve is computed (where q is the number of probability thresholds).  Thus, 
for an exact comparison between the binormal ROC curve and the binormal ROC Score, the same number of thresholds, 
q, must be used for each metric.  However, the binormal ROC Score will be closest to the empirical ROC Score 
when the ROC curve is constructed from m+1 probability thresholds, where m is the (fixed) number of ensemble 
members in each forecast.  Put differently, the empirical AUC, described by Mason and Graham (2002), approximates 
the area under the ROC curve when constructed with as many probability thresholds as the (fixed) number of 
ensemble members in each forecast.</p>

<p>By default, the algorithm described in Mason and Graham (2002) is used to compute the empirical AUC. 
Optionally, the AUC may be derived from the empirical ROC curve, which is constructed for a specified number of points. 
In that case, the empirical ROC curve is integrated using the trapezoid rule. In most cases, the algorithm described 
by Mason and Graham (2002) generates larger values of the empirical AUC (skill) than integrating the empirical 
ROC curve.</p>
