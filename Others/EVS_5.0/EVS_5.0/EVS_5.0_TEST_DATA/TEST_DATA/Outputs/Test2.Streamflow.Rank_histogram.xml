<!--
	Result file containing the results for a single metric by lead period.
	Some metrics, such as reliability diagrams, have results for specific thresholds 
	(e.g. probability thresholds).  In that case, the results are stored by lead period 
	and then by threshold value.  The actual data associated with a result always appears 
	within a 'values' tag.  A metric result that comprises a single value will appear as a 
	single value in this tag.  A metric result that comprises a 1D matrix will appear as a 
	row of values separated by commas in the input order.  A metric result that comprises a 
	2D matrix will appear as a sequence of rows, each with a 'values' tag, which are written 
	in the input order.  For example, a diagram metric with an x and y axis will comprise 
	two rows of data (i.e. two rows within two separate 'values' tags).  The default input 
	order would be data for the x axis followed by data for the y axis.  Data that refer to 
	cumulative probabilities are, by default, always defined in increasing size of probability.
