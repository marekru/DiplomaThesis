Primary goal of this paper is to describe design and implmentation of voxel editing tool. We also describe basic concept of volume graphics and its usage in commercial sphere, like modern game engines, animation etc. Next we mention examples of already existing solutions in this field, their strong and weak points and their influence on this work. In this paper we also analyze intersesting algorithmic problems, which appeard during implementation phase. \\
